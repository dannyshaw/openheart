# OpenHeart

A tiny, standalone tool that gives [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) a heartbeat. It runs `claude -p` on a schedule with your `HEARTBEAT.md` as the prompt — no opinions on what the heartbeat *does*. That's up to you.

Scheduling uses cron on Linux and a per-user LaunchAgent on macOS (see [macOS](#macos)).

Use it to check emails, review calendars, maintain memory files, monitor systems, triage inboxes, or anything else you'd want an agent doing in the background.

## How it works

1. You write a `HEARTBEAT.md` — this is the prompt Claude receives each run
2. OpenHeart calls `claude -p` with your heartbeat as a system prompt, running in your project directory so Claude picks up your `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, and other project config
3. Output is logged to `~/.openheart/logs/` and printed to stdout
4. The OS scheduler handles timing — cron on Linux, a LaunchAgent on macOS. No long-running daemon; if the machine is off (or, for the LaunchAgent, you're logged out), it just doesn't run

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated

## Install

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv tool install openheart

# From source
uv tool install -e /path/to/openheart

# Or with pip
pip install openheart
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create a HEARTBEAT.md in your project (see HEARTBEAT.md.example)
cp HEARTBEAT.md.example /path/to/your/project/HEARTBEAT.md

# 2. Test it
cd /path/to/your/project
openheart run --force

# 3. Install the cron job
openheart install --heartbeat HEARTBEAT.md --interval 30

# 4. Verify
openheart status
```

## CLI

### `openheart run [OPTIONS]`

Run a single heartbeat.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--heartbeat` | `HEARTBEAT.md` | Path to heartbeat file |
| `--model` | `sonnet` | Claude model to use |
| `--budget` | `0.50` | Max USD spend per run (`0` = no cap; cost is logged either way) |
| `--dir` | `.` | Project directory (Claude runs here) |
| `--allowed-tools` | — | Comma-separated tool whitelist |
| `--quiet-start` | `23` | Quiet hours start (24h) |
| `--quiet-end` | `8` | Quiet hours end (24h) |
| `--force` | `false` | Run even during quiet hours |

### `openheart install [OPTIONS]`

Install the scheduler and save settings to `~/.openheart/settings.json`. On macOS this installs a per-user LaunchAgent; elsewhere it installs a cron job. Accepts all `run` flags plus:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--interval` | `30` | Minutes between runs |
| `--method` | `auto` | `auto` (LaunchAgent on macOS, cron elsewhere), `launchd`, or `cron` |

### `openheart uninstall`

Remove the scheduler (LaunchAgent and/or cron job).

### `openheart status`

Show current settings, the installed schedule, last run info, and log paths.

### `openheart config [KEY] [VALUE]`

View or update saved settings.

```bash
openheart config              # show all settings
openheart config model        # get a single setting
openheart config model haiku  # set a single setting
```

## Settings

All configuration lives in `~/.openheart/settings.json`. CLI flags override settings; `openheart install` saves them.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `heartbeat` | `HEARTBEAT.md` | Path to heartbeat file |
| `model` | `sonnet` | Claude model |
| `budget` | `0.50` | Max USD per run |
| `dir` | `.` | Project directory |
| `allowed_tools` | `null` | Comma-separated tool whitelist |
| `quiet_start` | `23` | Quiet hours start (24h) |
| `quiet_end` | `8` | Quiet hours end (24h) |
| `interval` | `30` | Minutes between cron runs |

Only non-default values are persisted, so the file stays minimal:

```json
{
  "heartbeat": "/home/you/project/HEARTBEAT.md",
  "dir": "/home/you/project"
}
```

## Quiet hours

Quiet hours are enforced in the runner, not just cron — so `openheart run` during quiet hours silently exits unless you pass `--force`. Cron is also limited to the active window (e.g. `8-22` for defaults) as a belt-and-suspenders measure.

## macOS

On macOS, `openheart install` creates a per-user **LaunchAgent** at
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openheart.heartbeat.plist` and loads it into your
GUI session, instead of using cron.

This is deliberate. Claude Code stores its auth token in the macOS **login
keychain**, which is only unlocked inside your GUI (Aqua) login session. Cron
jobs run in a different security session that can't reach the unlocked keychain,
so a cron-spawned `claude` fails with `Not logged in · Please run /login`. A
LaunchAgent loaded into `gui/<uid>` runs in your session and has keychain access.

Consequences:

- The heartbeat runs whenever you're **logged in** — including while the screen
  is **locked**. Locking is not logging out; your session and keychain stay live.
- It does **not** run when you're logged out, fast-user-switched away, or after a
  reboot before you log back in. (A true `LaunchDaemon` would survive logout but
  runs as root in the system session with no keychain access, so it can't auth —
  that's why it's an Agent, not a Daemon.)

When the interval divides an hour evenly (5/10/15/20/30/60), the agent uses
`StartCalendarInterval` to fire only within the active window. Other intervals
use a 24/7 `StartInterval`; the runner's own quiet-hours check makes overnight
wake-ups no-op. Force cron instead with `openheart install --method cron`.

## Logs

All logs go to `~/.openheart/logs/`, keeping your project repo clean:

- `YYYY-MM-DD.log` — timestamped entries from each run (header includes `cost=$...`)
- `cron.log` — stdout/stderr from cron (Linux)
- `launchd.log` — stdout/stderr from the LaunchAgent (macOS)
- `costs.jsonl` — one line per run with `cost_usd`, `model`, `exit`, `duration_ms`, `num_turns` (see [Cost](#cost))

## Cost

Each run is invoked with `--output-format json`, so OpenHeart records the real
`total_cost_usd` claude reports. Rather than capping spend (a hard `--budget`
guillotines a run mid-task), the default posture is: **don't cap, but log**.

- Set `budget` to `0` to remove the cap entirely; keep a positive value to keep a
  hard ceiling. Either way the cost is recorded.
- Per-run cost lands in the daily log header and in `~/.openheart/logs/costs.jsonl`.
- `openheart status` shows today's and all-time spend and run counts.

A run still has a 10-minute wall-clock timeout as a backstop against a runaway
loop, independent of the budget.

## Writing a HEARTBEAT.md

Your heartbeat file is just a markdown prompt. Claude receives it as a system prompt along with a user message: `"Run heartbeat. Current time: {iso_timestamp}"`.

Since Claude runs in your project directory, it has access to everything it normally would in a Claude Code session — your `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, MCP servers, and any files in the project.

Some ideas for what to put in it:

- Check email for urgent messages
- Review calendar for upcoming events
- Scan WhatsApp/Slack for unread messages
- Maintain memory or context files
- Monitor budgets or financial data
- Triage an inbox of action items
- Run health checks on services

See [`HEARTBEAT.md.example`](HEARTBEAT.md.example) for a starter template.

## Security

OpenHeart runs Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` since it's unattended. To constrain what Claude can do, use `--allowed-tools` to whitelist specific tools:

```bash
openheart install --allowed-tools "Read,Grep,Glob,WebSearch"
```

## Design decisions

- **Settings file + CLI overrides** — `~/.openheart/settings.json` stores defaults, CLI flags override per-invocation
- **No long-running daemon** — the OS scheduler (cron, or a macOS LaunchAgent) fires `openheart run`. No PID files, no process management. macOS uses a LaunchAgent rather than cron specifically so the run can reach the login keychain (see [macOS](#macos))
- **Quiet hours in the runner** — not just in the cron schedule, so manual runs respect them too
- **Logs outside the project** — your repo stays clean
- **One cron entry** — `openheart run` reads settings from the file, so the crontab line is minimal
